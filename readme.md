## [Malasana Tie](https://www.theduchy.com/malasana)

1. This is the position into which your partner’s legs will be tied

2. Start with a Somerville Bowline or Square Knot Single Column around one of your partner’s legs. Consider 3 wraps instead of 2 to distribute the force across a wider area.

3. Place the cuff a little away from the knee itself. ~2-3” (5-7cm).
_There are several nerves and blood vessels that run just behind the knee joint that have very little protection and you don’t want to press on those._

4. I prefer the Slipped version of the Somerville Bowline because it gives you a way to quickly untie your partner if needed. See the demonstration below and in the video.

5. Position the knot so that it points to your partner’s back and then run the tail straight across their back.

6. Run the rope between their side and leg on other side, running under the leg.

7. Reverse tension under the leg.

8. Adjust tension. This is when you will be setting how far back the legs will be held (how close to the shoulders).
_It is more effective if you use two hands. One hand pulls the rope running across the back more toward the second knee while the other hand pulls the tail to take up that slack. This way you adjust the tension in both legs with one move._

9. Like this. This is the only time you are adjusting how far back the legs will be held. You will not be making the strap in the back tighter in the future.

10. Add a Hojo Cuff to this second leg. To do this … wrap the rope around the leg 2 or 3 times (match what you did on the other side.

11. …Adjust the tension in the cuff so that you can get two or three fingers under the band.

12. …Run the tail around the incoming line.

13. …Hook the tail with your finger, and…

14. …Pull the tail under all the strands of the cuff.

15. Keep tension on the tail once the cuff is tied.
_This prevents the Hojo Cuff from collapsing while you get it tied off._

16. Run the rope across the back, returning to the first cuff. Make sure these new lines lay parallel to the first.

17. Run the tail under all the lines of the first cuff. Do so on the side of the knot closer to the front of your partner. This will ensure that this new line does not interfere with the Somerville Bowline if you need to use the quick-release feature.

18. Adjust the tension so that the second line you laid across the back has the same tension as the first. Then lay a third set of lines across the back, again keeping them parallel to the lines that are already there.

19. Run your finger under the lines of the second cuff.
_In this picture, I put my finger in from the hip side. In the Video, I put it in from the knee side. It makes little real difference, but going in from the knee side (like in the video) will make the ropes lay just a little more orderly at this node. Do what works best for you._

20. Hook the tail and bring it under the cuff. Adjust the tension so that the third set of lines you laid across the back has the same tension as those already there.

21. Lock off the band with a Munter Hitch. To do this bring the tail up …

22. … and around the incoming lines.
![](assets/Malasana-22.jpg)

23. Then put your finger under the cuff on the other side of the knot.
![](assets/Malasana-23.jpg)

24. Hook the tail and pull it under the cuff on that side.
![](assets/Malasana-24.jpg)

25. Now use up any extra rope by wrapping it around the back strap. When you reach the end, lock off the tie with a half hitch around some of the strands or, if your rope has stop knots at the end like mine does…

26. …by tucking the ends between strands like this. The stop knots will act like buttons and hold the rope in place.
![](assets/Malasana-26.jpg)

27. Run your fingers under the strap in the back to make sure that the ropes are nicely in order and are parallel.
![](assets/Malasana-27.jpg)

28. You can slightly adjust where the strap will run.

29. The strap can also be held in place by laying your partner on their back …

30. … thus …

31. …or by using ropes from some other layer of bondage. In this example the strap from the Malasana is run under the stem of the chest harness, locking it in place.

## Quick Release 

1.	To release them quickly, pull the quick-release loop.  To do this:

2.	Grab the bight of the Slipped Somerville Bowline.
![Malasana - Quick Release (3)](assets/Malasana-Quick-Release-2.jpg)

3.	Give it a sharp jerk downward

4.	The knot falls mostly apart…

5.	…and you can quickly unwind the wraps…

6.	…quickly relieving the tension.
![Malasana - Quick Release (7)](assets/Malasana-Quick-Release-6.jpg)

7.	The ropes will completely fall off of that side.

8.	Then you can slip them off the other side and get your partner into a new position to relieve the issue.
